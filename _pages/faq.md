<p>This blog just launched, how can there be any frequently asked questions?
    <br>The frequency with which these questions have been asked is irrelevant.

<p>Why does this site look so bad?
    <br>First of all, rude. Second, this blog is part brain dump, part learning exercise. Posts will be about whatever I've got knocking around upstairs at the moment, while the actual site look and feel will be evolving as I learn and practice my web design/software development skills.
